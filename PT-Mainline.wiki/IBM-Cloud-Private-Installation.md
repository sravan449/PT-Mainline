## Installation
These instructions come from Owen Burroughs of the RIT team.  That team has ICP is running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.3

Although you probably wonâ€™t hit this (I did because of default naming in Centos), make sure the hostname of the machine is in lowercase only

I have installed ICP 2.1.0.3 CE (single node). I do not believe it is worth installing any earlier version, not least because upgrading from 2.1.0.2 failed for me. 

The ultimate install followed the instructions at:

[Installing IBM Cloud Private-CE](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0.3/installing/install_containers_CE.html)

The various command line tools you need to use have to be installed/configured separately afterwards as they are not part of the main install:
