Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.  Docker performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization.

In a Kubernetes environment, Docker runs on each of the worker nodes, and runs the configured pods.  Docker takes care of downloading the images and starting the containers.
